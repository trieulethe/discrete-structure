> **Product Rule :** Assume a procedure consists of performing a sequence of *m* task in order. Furthermore, assume that for each  *i* = 1, 2, ..., *m*, there are N-i ways to do the i-th task, regardless of how the first *i* - 1 task were done. Then, there are N1N2...Nm ways to do the entire procedure.
